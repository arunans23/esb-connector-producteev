    vi)     Navigate to Labels and create a label using the default values. Keep the label ID (id displays in the URL when the label is selected)for further reference.
   
 6. Follow the below mentioned steps to add valid certificate to access Producteev API over https.

    i)   Extract the certificate from browser(Mozilla Firefox) by navigating to 'https://www.producteev.com/'.
    ii)  Go to new ESB 4.9.0 folder and place the downloaded certificate into "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" and 
         "<PRODUCTEEV_CONNECTOR_HOME>/src/test/resources/keystores/products" folders.
    iii) Navigate to "<ESB_HOME>/repository/resources/security/" using command prompt and execute the following command.

         keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore client-truststore.jks -alias "CERT_NAME"

         This command will import Producteev certificate into keystore. 
         To import the certificate give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

         NOTE: CERT_FILE_NAME - Replace CERT_FILE_NAME with the file name that was extracted from Producteev with the extension. (e.g. Producteev.crt)
               CERT_NAME      - Replace CERT_NAME with an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. Producteev)

    iv) Navigate to "<PRODUCTEEV_CONNECTOR_HOME>/src/test/resources/keystores/products/" using command prompt and execute the following command.

         keytool -importcert -file CERT_FILE_NAME -keystore wso2carbon.jks -alias "CERT_NAME" 

         This command will import Producteev certificate in to keystore. Give "wso2carbon" as password.
         To import the certificate give "wso2carbon" as password. Press "Y" to complete certificate import process.

         NOTE: CERT_FILE_NAME - Replace CERT_FILE_NAME with the file name that was extracted from Producteev with the extension. (e.g. Producteev.crt)
               CERT_NAME      - Replace CERT_NAME with an arbitrary name for the certificate. (e.g. Producteev).
